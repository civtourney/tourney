                 <h2>No back seating</h2> 

                <p>
                    No back seating allowed In tournaments, backseating is typically discouraged or not allowed for several reasons:<br/><br/>

                    1.Fairness and competitive integrity: Tournaments aim to provide a level playing field for all participants. Allowing backseating would introduce an external influence that could potentially give certain players an unfair advantage. It could undermine the skill and strategy aspect of the game and disrupt the competitive balance.<br/><br/>

                    2.Focus and concentration: Players in a tournament environment need to concentrate on their own decision-making and gameplay. Unsolicited advice or comments from spectators can be distracting and interfere with a player's ability to think critically and make strategic choices.<br/><br/>

                    3.Respect for players' autonomy: Backseating can diminish a player's sense of control and personal agency over their gameplay. Players should have the opportunity to make their own decisions, learn from their mistakes, and experience the game on their own terms without external interference.<br/><br/>

                    4.Etiquette and sportsmanship: Tournaments often have established rules and codes of conduct to promote sportsmanship and respectful behavior. Backseating can be seen as a breach of etiquette, as it intrudes upon the space of the players and disregards their preferences and focus during the game.<br/><br/>

                    5.Consistency and uniformity: To maintain a consistent and uniform experience for all players, tournament organizers generally establish guidelines and restrictions on spectator behavior. By disallowing backseating, organizers can ensure a standardized environment where players compete solely based on their own skills and strategies.<br/><br/>
