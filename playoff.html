                        Players who ranked from 1st to 21st in the qualification stage and have at least one full stream are eligible to participate in the playoffs.
                        In all playoff matches, the slots are distributed according to the qualification results. (LOOK ABOVE)
                        The nations are determined in the same way as in the qualifying stage. It is not allowed to change the set of nations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="important">IMPORTANT!</span> In all playoff matches, you are required to stream your games! You are also required to ensure that the stream is saved and available after the game.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In playoff matches, at the organizers' request, you will need to enable emote-only mode on your Twitch channel (or other platform you are streaming on).
                        use the commands <span class="important"> /emoteonly </span> and <span class="important">/emoteonlyoff </span>on Twitch.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In round #1, slots are determined according to the scheme (see above).
                        In round #2, all players who did not win in the first round and the next three players according to the qualification participate.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first six players participating in the second round according to the qualification are randomly divided into three matches. Players who played together in the first round cannot play together in the second round.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then the remaining participants are randomly divided into matches. Players who did not participate in the first round (#19, #20, #21) are divided according to the scheme.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The event organizers are responsible for the first slots in the matches. In other words hosting and contacting people
                        In all matches, player rankings are determined similarly to the qualification stage. In case of a tie in the average score, priority is given to the player who ranked higher in the qualification stage.

                        Exactly one week is allocated for each round of the playoffs, and each player must check in to the corresponding event within two days to avoid being replaced.<br/>
                        Replacement:
                         Of course, any substitutions are highly undesirable, but sometimes they still need to be made. The list of candidates for substitution is formed from players who are not participating in the current round, according to their places in the qualification."In the first round, players are replaced by players according to their placement in the qualification round (starting from 19th place). The player who was replaced is then added to the list of potential replacements."
                        If the substitute player who entered in the first round makes it to the final, they play in the final regardless of whether the replaced player returns. If the substituting player does not make it to the final, they are moved to the list of candidates for substitution.<br/>
                         Players for substitution in the second round are selected from the list of candidates in a similar way..
                         All disputed moments regarding player substitutions are resolved by the judging committee.
                         If a player does not respond within two days from the moment the party is announced (please note, parties are announced almost immediately after the completion of the previous round).<br/>
                         The player does not actively participate in the discussion of the game time.<br/>
                        If the players of the game cannot come to a consensus on the time of the game, a difficult decision must be made to replace the player who is the most time-limited. However, organizers will only make this decision in extreme cases when there is a risk of not playing the game at all.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The procedure for replacing a player in case of their absence at the scheduled start time of the game is as follows:
                        The party organizer contacts the substitute players in order of priority.
                        This means "You need to wait for 10 minutes for a response or a friend request to be accepted."
                        If a user is offline or has not responded within 10 minutes, you can move on to the next candidate.<br/>
                         After finding the necessary player, the organizer contacts any member of the judging committee, explaining the reason for the substitution and the procedure for selecting a replacement player. If the substitution is approved, it is carried out.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‚¶Å Placement distribution:
