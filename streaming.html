                    <span class="important">>IMPORTANT!</span> If you stream through Twitch, make sure you have the "checkbox" for automatic stream saving turned on. It is highly recommended to figure out how you plan to stream and check if your recordings are being saved before the start of the tournament.
                    The stream should have a delay no greater than 30 seconds...<br/><br/>
                    <span class="important">>IMPORTANT!</span> Deleting recordings of your streams before the end of the tournament is prohibited! (specifically the tournament, not your participation in it).
                    The video recording should have a resolution no less than 640x480 and a frame rate of at least 20 frames per second.<br/><br/>
                    <span class="important">>IMPORTANT!</span> The video recording of the stream for the match must be provided within a week from the end of the match.
                    If you will not be able to meet these deadlines, you must inform the tournament organizers in advance.. 
                    If you do not provide a video recording of the stream for the qualifying winning match, you will receive a penalty in the form of 50% of the points earned for the match.
                    If you do not have any complete recorded streams by the end of the qualification, you will not make it to the playoffs.. <br/><br/>
                    <span class="important">>IMPORTANT!</span>  In the playoffs, you must stream all of your matches..<br/><br/>
                    <span class="important">>IMPORTANT!</span> you have to go into video producer on twitch and highlight your published video. <br/>
