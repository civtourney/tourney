                    <h2>Time for games</h2>
                    <p>
                        By default, game time is considered to be from 7:00 pm to 2:00 am. Of course, this does not mean that you are required to play only from seven in the evening until two in the morning, but if you cannot play during this period (or most of it), it is better not to participate in the tournament.<br/>
                        Players are free to agree on any convenient time for them..<br/>
                        All specified times are considered according to Athens time UTC +3 , unless otherwise agreed.<br/>
                        If the game lasts more than 6 hours from the start, players can request a save and continuation of the game (if not otherwise specified in the event).
                        
                    </p>

                    <h2>Creating and conducting your own event in the qualification round</h2>
                    <p>
                        You create an event (Thread) in discord game section with the name "TournamentGame - YourNicknameInSteam". From this moment, you become the organizer of this game, and you have corresponding obligations, the successful fulfillment of which will earn you a bonus point.
                        In the event, you set the start time of the game and indicate when the save will be made (if planned)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep track of who is posting in your event.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first five people who post, you create a game. That is, you do not choose those whom you like more, but you must play with the first five who posted. Two exceptions when choosing players among those who posted:

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You must ensure that the conditions for playing with repeat players are met for all participants. In case of a violation, priority is given to those who posted earlier.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you have selected five opponents, choose a free room on our Discord server, invite all participants there, and discuss all the details more specifically there..

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Organize the process of choosing nations (see below).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Who will physically host the game is proposed to be decided by the players themselves, based on the internet and computer capabilities of each of them. By default, this is the event organizer.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The event organizer writes in the tournament thread that the game has started, listing the nicknames of the playing players and their nations, and in parentheses write the number of the game that each player is playing. An example of a message about the start of the game:

                    </p>

                    <img src="/images/starting.png" alt=""><br/><br/>

                    <p>
                        If you make a save, you can simply indicate the game number for you in the message in the tournament thread. Also in this message, you need to specify the time for the continuation game that you have appointed.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the message about the end of the game, you can also limit yourself to the game number for you. It is necessary to indicate the winner, the distribution of places or list the players (or nations) who will participate in the final vote. Examples of such messages:
                    </p>
                    <img src="/images/starting1.png" alt=""><br/>

                            The following ideas are prohibited in diplomacy: war until the end of the game (="suiciding"). Of course, you should distinguish the situation when players simply do not reconcile until the end of the game.
                            playing exclusively against one particular player, for example, "I won't let you win". Do not confuse with the situation when the point was that "I won't let you win just like that".

                            You can propose a distribution of places (specifically a distribution, not just saying who won), which ends the game if it is unanimously accepted. So, you can say "let's vote for Inca to win, second place for me, third for China, fourth for Assyria, if you agree, put a plus sign in the chat, if you disagree, put a minus sign" (someone may propose a different option and players also vote), but you cannot say "let's recognize Inca's victory and end the game". 
                            During the voting for a distribution of places, it is not allowed to influence the voters (for example, you cannot say "otherwise, I'll come after you") - ideally, it should take place in silence. Of course, players can propose their own options for distribution.

                    <p>

                    <h2>When is it okay to leave a game?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A player has the right to leave the game in the following situations:<br/>
                        the game has not entered its final stage <span class="important">>info era:</span> the player can leave after losing (or possibly recapturing) their capital within 10 turns.
                        If the game has entered its final stage(info era) , in addition to losing their capital, the player also needs the consent of all other players to leave the game.

                        If the player has not lost their capital, but is in last place in all key indicators with a significant lag, they can initiate a vote by writing "irr" in the game's general chat. The vote is only valid during this turn. To leave, they need the agreement of absolutely all other players<br/> (who vote in the game's general chat with "+" or "-"). This option can be used before the game enters its final stage, but no more than once every 20 turns.


                    </p>
                    <h2> How and when can a game be ended?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let's call the turn in which one of the players entered the Information Era the turn from which the game entered the final stage. All players who were in the game at the time of the start of this turn are considered participants in the final stage.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a player left the game or was eliminated before the final stage, they will take the lowest place among the remaining players.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All the players who have reached the final stage of the game (regardless of further developments in the game) participate in the vote to determine the final rankings.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the game ended with one of the players winning before the final stage, then all players who were in the lobby at the time of the end of the game participate in the vote..

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are required to send me (aggressor) your final rankings within 24 hours after the end of the game.
                        In case a player suddenly disappears or is disqualified, one of the members of the judging committee will vote instead of him/her.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For each player, the average arithmetic mean will be calculated among all received scores, excluding one minimum and one maximum.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to end the game after 100 turns, but before entering the final stage, if all players agree on the distribution of places. Then each player receives points without additional calculations according to their place. If the players do not come to an agreement on the distribution of places, the game continues until one of the players wins.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the game enters the final stage and all players are still in the game, you can end the game by unanimous agreement on the distribution of places, or declare a winner and the remaining places will be distributed by voting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a game has entered its final stage and at least one player has been eliminated since the start of the final stage, the remaining players can unanimously agree to recognize one player as the winner, and the other places will be distributed by a vote.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        If there are only two players left in the game, one of them can always surrender. If this happens in the final stage of the game, the surrendering player participates in the vote. If it happens before the final stage, the surrendering player takes the second place.
