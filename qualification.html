                <h3>Duration of the Qualifying Round</h3>
                <p>
                    The qualifying phase will last for a maximum of one month from the start of the tournament.
                    If 75% of the participants have played their third games, then the countdown for the last four days until the end of the qualification begins (they must be completed no later than the date specified above).
                    Therefore, it is not allowed to schedule additional games on days after the announced date.
                    Games that have started or continued on the last allowable day of qualifying games will be played without any additional matches.

                </p>

                <h3>General Format of the Qualifying Round</h3>
                <p>
                    Each participant must play at least three, but no more than five games.
                    For each game, the player receives points: base points for their ranking + additional points (for the difficulty of the nation, for a video recording, and for organizing the event). Points may be deducted for violating the rules of the game.
                    The three best games are selected from the ones played based on the points earned in them. In case of a tie, preference is given to the games that have better additional indicators.Such as nation dificculty etc..

                </p>

                <h3>Uniqueness of Opponents in Qualifying Round Games</h3>
                <p>
                    In each of the first two games, you are required to play against unique opponents, no matter what.
                    Starting from the third game (i.e., in the third, fourth, and fifth games), you may play against two repeated opponents. It is not allowed to play against three or more repeated opponents in one game.
                    You cannot play against the same player more than twice.
                    Having more than two unfinished games at the same time is forbidden.

                </p>
                <h3>Time limits for games in the qualification round</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have not started the next game within a week after the start of the tournament or after the end of your last game, you will be blocked from the tournament. This means that you will no longer be able to play preliminary games, but your results in previous games will not be cancelled, and you may still advance to the playoffs if you have played well up to that point.
                    The week is counted from the host's message with the results of your previous game.
                    If you are unable to play for a week or more for any reason, you must inform the organizers in advance to avoid being blocked from the tournament.
                    For example, if the tournament starts at 5:30 pm on February 18th, you must finish your first game before 5:30 pm on February 25th. If the host publishes the results of your first game at 7:00 pm on February 21st, you must play your second game before 7:00 pm on February 28th.
                    Any game must be completed <span class="important">> within four days</span> from the start of the game. Therefore, if you can only play once or twice a week, participating in the tournament may not be the best idea. If you need to extend the deadline, please notify the organizers in advance.

                <h3>Rules for awarding points for rankings in the qualification round matches</h3>
                <p>
                    Standard points for rankings in matches are:

                </p>
                 <img src="/images/Points.png" alt=""> 
                 <p>
                    Some matches may end with a vote for rankings
                    If, after this vote (more details on the post-match vote are provided in section IV), a player's average rank is not a whole number, then their points are calculated using the formula below. The resulting value is rounded to the nearest tenth. The formula is simply a proportional calculation of points.
                 </p>
                 <img src="/images/points1.png" alt="">
                 <p>
                    If the average rank is a whole number or the player's rank is known in advance, they are awarded points without additional calculations.
                    Example calculation of points for a rank.

                 <h3>Additional points in qualification round games</h3>
                 <p>+1 for each recorded stream.<br/>
                     For a corrupted   stream, a reduced number of points (0, 0.5) is awarded.<br/>
                    +1 for organizing the game.  
                
                However, a penalty of -0.5 is given for:
                Failure to post a message about the start or continuation of the game within an hour after the start.
                Failure to post a message about the end of the game (within 24 hours), or about making a save (also within 24 hours, but before the start of the next game).
                If the event organizer drops out of the game, they must still monitor the game's progress and fulfill their duties (for example, arranging for information on the save, the game's end, so they can post in the tournament thread).
                You cannot go into negative points, but it is easy to lose points for organizing.
                 Nation strength coefficient.
                Each nation in this tournament has its own base points (from 0 to 4, see below).
                These points are added to your base points for your place in the game.
                Illustrative example:

                <h3>Additional criteria in case of a tie in points at the end of the qualification  round</h3><br/><br/>
                <p>
                    In case of a tie in points, the following indicators are taken into account in descending order of significance:
                    Number of games played (criterion applies in reverse order)
                    Number of records among all games
                    Number of first, second, third, etc. places among all games
                    Total number of points scored by opponents (15 terms) in the three best games
                    Number of hours at the time of the tournament start (criterion applies in reverse order)
